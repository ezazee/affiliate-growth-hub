I have updated the Next.js configuration to allow images from the required hostname.

**Important:** For this change to take effect, you must stop your Next.js development server (if it's running) and restart it.
You can usually stop it by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running, and then start it again with `npm run dev` (or the command you usually use).

After restarting the server, the image error should be resolved.
